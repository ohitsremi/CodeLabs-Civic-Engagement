# EngageForChange

## App Description
Our goal is to get people connected with volunteering opportunities since there is a lack of volunteering organizations that are readily available on a platform that can post calls for volunteers. This would include a firebase database that would store and manage the data collected. Organizations can enter for volunteer opportunities and the potential volunteers can use the search engine feature to look up. We would create a homepage that would provide two options: one for volunteers and one for volunteer opportunities. So, in one place it would be a single app that can bring these two together.
